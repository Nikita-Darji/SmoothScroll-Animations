# SmoothScroll-Animations
Creative scroll animation project built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP

This is a small front-end project where I experimented with smooth scrolling and scroll-based animations using GSAP.
The idea was to create a fullscreen scrolling effect with stacked sections, background videos/images, and some animated text that zooms in and out as you move through the page.

Features

1. Smooth scrolling effect (GSAP ScrollSmoother)
2. Sticky fullscreen sections with images & background videos
3. Animated text that scales and fades on scroll
4. Simple, clean design focused on visuals

Tech Used ðŸ› 

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) with ScrollTrigger + ScrollSmoother

This is more of a practice project for me to play around with GSAP and scroll effects, but it can be useful as a base for landing pages, portfolio sections, or creative websites.
